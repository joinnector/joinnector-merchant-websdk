# Client Web View SDK
nector.io is a loyalty and reward APIs platform, that allows businesses to reward deals, offers, wallet points to their customers for various actions.

If your wish to implement your own UI we recommend you to contribute to our webview repository which has all the API integrations in place, all you have to do is add new UI pages with your design guidelines and make your customized theme reach all the merchants using nector including you.

This repository contains code for nector webview SDK and master branch is live at https://join.nector.io

Whenever we update the https://join.nector.io user interface or add new features, they will be rolled out to merchants in real-time who are using this webview in their web or application.
