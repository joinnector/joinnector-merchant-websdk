# Client Web View SDK
nector.io is a loyalty and reward APIs platform, that allows businesses to reward deals, offers, wallet points to their customers for various actions.

If your wish to implement your own UI we recommend you to contribute to this repository which has all the API integrations in place, all you have to do is add new UI pages with your design guidelines and make your customized theme reach all the merchants using nector.

This repository contains code for nector webview SDK and master branch is live at https://join.nector.io

Currently we support only one theme https://join.nector.io/nector the pathname represents the theme name

Whenever we update the https://join.nector.io/ user interface or add new features, they will be rolled out to all merchants who are using this webview.
